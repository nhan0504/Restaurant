# Project name
Restaurant

A web application that features some of the dishes I made. The web app is hosted on AWS EC2. Check it out [here](http://nhanwebapp.hopto.org/)

# Project status
This project is currently in development. All neccessary features are implemented. However, like and share button are not working. I want to incorperate google map API to show location of the restaurant and resize the menu bar when open the website on mobile devices. The web app won't load if click refresh.

# Reflection
This was my first project working with Angular framework. The aims of the project was to get familier with Angular to create a single-page application. 

One of the main challenge for me was to host it on AWS EC2 so that anyone can access my web app through the URL. This led me to further understand networking and how the Internet work.
